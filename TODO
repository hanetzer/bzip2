TODO for autoconf based version:

Some mandatory files for autoconf based packages are now empty: AUTHORS,
ChangeLog.

Some sections of these files needs update for autoconf are now outdated
and should refer to INSTALL file: README, words* (actually, words0 and
words2 seems to be unused and may be deleted completely).
